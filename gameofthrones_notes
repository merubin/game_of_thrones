Rails Game of Thrones Notes

1. Create Rails environment inside existing directory

$ rails new . -d postgresql

Create the Database
rails db:create
Created database 'scribble_development'
Created database 'scribble_test'

2. Create Post and Comment models
They go in the app/models directories.
syntax:

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  # AR classes are singular and capitalized by convention
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
end
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :post
end





rails g model house  name

Model House name,	lord,	region,	description,	img_url
Model Character name	house_id	portrayed_by	picture_url	seasons	first_seen	status
rails g model character name portrayed_by	img_url	seasons	first_seen	status house:references
rails g model house name lord region description img_url


3. Migrations
Create both the POSTS and COMMENTS migration files

rails g migration create_characters name	portrayed_by	img_url	seasons	first_seen	status house:references
rails g migration create_houses  name,	lord,	region,	description,	img_url


Migrate with the following command
rails db:migrate

4 Seeds creation
modify the db/seeds.rb file to drop data and create records
run the rails command to insert the seed data

rails db:seed

Next go to routes.rb in the config directory

resources :posts do
  resources  :comments
end

create two controllers

house_controllers.rb
character_controllers.rb
